module Fibonacci where


{- Fibonacci numbers:

The Fibonacci numbers Fn are defined as the sequence of integers,
beginning with 0 and 1, where every integer in the sequence is the
sum of the previous two. That is,

F0 = 0
F1 = 1
Fn = Fn 1 + Fn 2 (n   2)

For example, the first fifteen Fibonacci numbers are

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, . . .

It s quite likely that you ve heard of the Fibonacci numbers before.
The reason they re so famous probably has something to do with the
simplicity of their definition combined with the astounding variety of
ways that they show up in various areas of mathematics as well as art
and nature. -}


{- Exercise 1

Translate the above definition of Fibonacci numbers directly into a
recursive function definition of type
fib :: Integer -> Integer
so that fib n computes the nth Fibonacci number Fn.
Now use fib to define the infinite list of all Fibonacci numbers,
fibs1 :: [Integer] -}
